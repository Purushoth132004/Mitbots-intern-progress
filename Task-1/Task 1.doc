Theoretical Understanding

1.What are Semantic Tags?
   	 Semantic Tags are used to build the web page in an organized way. They give better understanding to humans as well as machines compared to div and span. 

Some of the tags are 
    header - indicates the top section 
    footer - indicates the bottom section
    aside - indicates the side bar 
    main - contains the main content 
    section - the contents of main are divided into different sections

2.What is div? 
    Using div it is possible to create structure for other tags 
    without div it is difficult to split the tags into separate components
    The primary use of div is acts a container and has a block-level scope

    Common uses are 
        Involves in grouping of tags
        It creates layout for using CSS

    As mentioned Earlier, The div tag does not have any meaning whereas semantic tags have defined meaning which is understandable by humans as well as machines     



3. Responsiveness in CSS
           Responsiveness means the website should work for all the screen sizes from desktop to mobiles. It can be achieved by using relative units like %,em etc….
           Media queries will be responsible for making the webpage responsive 

4. Positioning in CSS
             This prosperity specifies the type of positioning of  a element 
	  
	Few Types are 
		→ Static
		→ Relative 
		→ Absolute 
		→ Fixed
		→ Sticky

Static  - Default position type 

Relative - Can modify the element using left or right , up or down 
		Note: Either of them will only work 
	
Absolute - Unlike relative, The absolute removes the element from the 
                document flow and places it relatively to the next parent . It is 
                 possible to place anywhere in the webpage 

Sticky - It sticks the content to a webpage. While scrolling the sticked 
             content will not move 

Fixed - This property does not allow the content to move . If scrolled the 
            element will not move




5.What is a Flex Box ?
	The flex box has a property which is used to arrange elements in the container in an easy way. To use this we should set the display property to flex . The flex has few important property .This makes the webpage more responsive

→justify-content aligns items horizontally
→align-items align items vertically
→flex-direction rowwise or columnwise

6.What is a CSS grid?
	It compromises the drawbacks of flex , Flex is one - dimensional where as Grid is two dimensional it allows the developers to arrange row and columns
	To use this we should set the display property to grid
